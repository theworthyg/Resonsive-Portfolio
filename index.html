      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/IMG_5507.JPG" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>Born and raised in Hanover, New Hampshire, I've practically lived in this great granite state my entire life. After graduating from the University of New Hampshire, I have been searching for what will be my next chapter in life.</p>

      <p>Growing up near rivers, lakes, forests, and mountains - It may not surprise you that I spend a lot of time outdoors. This can be anythng from fishing with my friends to flying across the state in my father's Cessna 180.</p>

      <p>Although I have a great love for nature and the outdoors, I also have a passion for tinkering with technology. Cameras, computers, videogames, gadgets, and even vehicles all spark my interests.</p>
